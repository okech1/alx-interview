0x02. Minimum Operations
Description
This project involves solving the "Minimum Operations" problem in Python. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to produce exactly n characters in a text file using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste". The project explores algorithmic approaches involving prime factorization, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms to find the most efficient solution.

Concepts Covered
Dynamic Programming: Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution incrementally.
Prime Factorization: Decomposing the number n into its prime factors to determine the minimum operations.
Code Optimization: Writing efficient Python code to solve the problem within a reasonable time and space complexity.
Greedy Algorithms: Making the best choice at each step to minimize the number of operations.
Requirements
Python Version: The code is designed to run on Python 3.4.3.
PEP 8 Compliance: All Python files must follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
Execution: All files must be executable.
Files
0-minoperations.py: Contains the implementation of the minOperations function.
0-main.py: A test file to validate the functionality of the minOperations function.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
