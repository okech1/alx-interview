0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Description
This project focuses on validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. The UTF-8 encoding can represent every character in the Unicode character set using one to four bytes. This project requires a solid understanding of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn:

How to use bitwise operations in Python to manipulate bits.
The rules and structure of the UTF-8 encoding scheme.
How to handle and manipulate data at the byte level in Python.
Efficient use of logical operations for decision-making within the program.
Requirements
Python version: Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
PEP 8 Style: All your Python code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x).
File permissions: All your files must be executable.
Project directory: All files should be located in the 0x04-utf8_validation directory.
Mandatory file: README.md must be present in the root of the project folder.
